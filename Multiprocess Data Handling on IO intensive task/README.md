This note demonstrates how to use multiple processes on data parallelism tasks.

The experiment is only suitable for GB level data. In my case, I used 12 GB of data.

You need to create a `data/` dir to run this experiment.

Under `data/`, you need to create `raw/` and `processed/` dirs.

See the notebook for details.
