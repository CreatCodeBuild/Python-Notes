# Python HTTP2 Web Server Framework

I had heard of that HTTP2 was the future since the end of 2015 and I had watached some Python talks about HTTP2 in PyConf2016.

But one year has passed, I have not found any full HTTP2 server framework yet.

Also, async programming has been widely talked about but not many people seemed to actually do it. 
(Unless you consider JavaScript people, where they have no choice)

Furthermore, generator style async io is much more fun than callback style.

April 23rd, 2017, Sunday, I woke up and felt bored and decided to make one of my own. Since I had little prior web knowledge, this would be a super fun project for me.
